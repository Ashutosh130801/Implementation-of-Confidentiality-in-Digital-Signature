# Implementation-of-Confidentiality-in-Digital-Signature
Our project is a prototype to show how to ensure CIA triad in case of Digital signature in Online document transfer by encrypting the signature itself ,  we have used RSA algorithm to do so. in future research we can use technologies like blockchain and other possibilities to make digital signatures more secure.
